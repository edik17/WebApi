Group composed of:
Doctors Edoardo, Luciani Giovanni, Santolini Alice


Development of Project number 3: Creation of a web API that allows the management of a multi-user distribution list.

The application must have a list of users with the following properties:
- Email
- First name
- Surname
- Password

Each user can own one or more distribution lists.
Each distribution list has the following properties:
- Name of the list
- Owner
- a list of Recipient Emails


The bees that will need to be made are the following:
  - Creation of a user (anonymous without authentication)
  - Authentication
  - Creation of a distribution list
  - Adding a recipient to a distribution list
  - Deleting a recipient from a distribution list
  - Sending a communication to a distribution list.
    Through this call, an email must be sent to all members of the distribution list

  - Given a recipient get all the distribution lists associated with him
    The search will have to page the results, based on a parameter passed in the call

    # Creation of the db
    To create the database, create a user with the following characteristics:
    - User Id: user distributions
    - Password: distributions

     Subsequently you can dump the db present in the repository in:

    Unicam.Paradigmi.Progetto.Models-->Database Folder-->scriptFinale.sql

    # Starting the solution
    Set Unicam.Paradigmi.Progetto.Web-Deployment as startup project to be able to test bees with swagger
